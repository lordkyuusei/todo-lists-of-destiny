# wat are thoz
Those are not the greatest todo lists in the world, no. Those are just tributes.

# wat 'bout the y
Long time ago me and my computer here
We was hitchhikin' down a long and lonesome road.
All of a sudden, there shined a shiny demon,
in the middle of the road.

And HE SAID:

"Do a todolist app in every freakin' language, or I'll eat your soul."

Well, me and my laptop,
we looked at each other,
and we each said:

"Okay."

# wat 'bout the when you release stuffs
Once every hundred-thousand years or so,
When the sun doth shine and the moon doth glow,
And the grass doth grow.

see u soon mb
